                <p>The <a href="https://shorturl.at/EMDp2"> <b>BMW M4</b> </a> is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M GmbH, that has been built since 2014.
                As part of the renumbering that splits the coupé and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3.
                Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon
                fiber, such as on the roof of the car, and the door cards.The M4 also had a Competition Sport Lightweight (CSL) version that was 100kg lighter than the standard M4

                <h2>Mercedes-AMG GT</h2>
                <p> The <a href="https://shorturl.at/45wb0"> <b>Mercedes-AMG GT</b> </a> a series of 2-door sports cars produced by German automobile manufacturer Mercedes-AMG. The car was introduced on 9 September 2014 and 
                was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show.[1] While not directly replacing the SLS AMG (competing in a different segment), 
                it is the second sports car developed entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG. The Mercedes-AMG GT went on sale in two variants (GT and GT S) in March 2015, while a 
                GT3 racing variant of the car was introduced in 2015. A high performance variant called the GT R was introduced in 2016. A GT4 racing variant, targeted at semi-professional 
                drivers and based on the GT R variant, was introduced in 2017. In 2021, a new variant called the AMG GT Black Series was released. All variants are assembled at the 
                Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.
