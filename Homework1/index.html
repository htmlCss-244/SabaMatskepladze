        <h3>BMW M4</h3>
        <p>
            The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division, <br> BMW M GmbH, that has been built since 2014.
            As part of the renumbering that splits the coupé and convertible variants of the 3 Series <br> into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. 
            Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, <br> suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including 
            increased use of carbon fiber,<br>  such as on the roof of the car, and the door cards.
            The M4 also had a Competition <br> Sport Lightweight (CSL) version that was 100kg lighter than the standard M4.

        <h3>AMG C63S Coupe</h3>
        <p>
            Mercedes-Benz also revealed the high-performance C 63 coupe from Mercedes-AMG at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show. The C63 coupe <br> features many distinct design elements to set 
            it apart from its tamer sibling. The most obvious is the aggressive front bumper, <br>which features larger scoops to feed more air to the car's twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V-8 
            as well as to its high-performance brakes. The grille is also unique, <br>and the hood features some muscular ripples that the regular C-Class Coupe does not.The C 63 coupe also
             benefits from a wider track, as evidenced by the pumped wheel arches. <br> The wheels are also bigger on the Mercedes-AMG model with 19 inches in diameter. The C-Class Coupe comes 
             with 18-inch wheels as standard.<br>The mechanical package is almost identical to the C 63 sedan.This means 469 hp (350 kW) in the C 63 coupe and 503 hp (375 kW) <br> for the S-badged model.
              Drive will be to the rear wheels only, via a paddle-shifted, seven-speed automatic transmission
